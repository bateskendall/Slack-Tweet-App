# Slack Tweet App
A Slack app that allows user to tweet directly from Slack. Created with Node.js.
## Getting Started
The following instructions will help you get this app up and running on your workspace.

### Prerequisites
##### The Obvious:
- Twitter and a Slack workspace

##### The Less Obvious:
- A new slack app, a new twitter app, and a server to host the code

### Deployment
[Here](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps#creating_apps) and [here](https://iag.me/socialmedia/how-to-create-a-twitter-app-in-8-easy-steps/) are a couple of helpful guides to setting up a functioning Slack and Twitter app. For the host server, I used [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). It's free and will deploy code straight from a GitHub repository.
